# BachelorThesis-MarijnJonkman-6644511
Python codes used for the bachelor thesis (title) by Marijn Jonkman (link to the report: (link)). 
The first two codes are written for the Galton-Watson model. 
Code 1 plots the probability generating function for R_0<1 and R_0>1. It also plots the critical equation of this model. Code 2 calculates the probability of a small outbreak (q)
The last three codes are written for theNewman-Watts model.
Code 3 plots histograms of the outbreaksize and the exponential function that approximates this. Code 4 calculates $\lambda$, the expected outbreak size and the critical equation. Code 5 calculates the probability of a small outbreak.
